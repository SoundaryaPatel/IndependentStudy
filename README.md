Bayesian analysis for multilevel structure models
This study includes-
Understanding multilevel model structure based on bayesian approach for normal data an binary data.
Understanding the multilevel model structure in R rstanarm package models.
Based on this model structure generated synthetic data for the multilevel structure.
Tried to fit different rstanarm models on the synthetic data.
Compared the models based on Leave one out cross validation.
